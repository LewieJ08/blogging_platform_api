# Blogging Platform Web App

A simple yet functional blogging platform that allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, **delete**, and **search** blog posts. The app is built with a Python-Flask backend and a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

This project is an improved version of one of my earlier blogging apps. In this updated release, the user interface has been enhanced for better usability and design, and the backend now uses a full PostgreSQL database instead of storing post data in JSON files. Additionally, JavaScript has been introduced to handle HTTP requests with the correct request types (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the user's actions, resulting in a more robust and RESTful experience.
